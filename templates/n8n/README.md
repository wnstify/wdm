[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is an open-source workflow automation platform. Connect apps, automate tasks, and build complex workflows with a visual editor. A powerful, self-hosted alternative to Zapier and Make.

## Features

- **Visual Workflow Builder** — Drag-and-drop interface
- **400+ Integrations** — Connect to popular services
- **Code When Needed** — JavaScript/Python for custom logic
- **Self-Hosted** — Full control over your data
- **Webhooks** — Trigger workflows from external events
- **Scheduling** — Run workflows on a schedule
- **Error Handling** — Built-in retry and error workflows

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- External Docker network
- Reverse proxy (Caddy, Nginx, Traefik)

## Installation

This template is managed by **wdm** — wdm renders `docker-compose.yml.tmpl` and `.env.tmpl` into your stack directory, pre-creates the `n8n-front` network plus `n8n-db` and `n8n-runners` (both `--internal`, no internet egress), generates `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN` via `crypto/rand`, derives `WEBHOOK_URL` from `N8N_HOST`, and runs `docker compose up -d` at install time. Both secrets are marked `regenerable=false` — rotating them post-install would either lose saved credentials (`N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) or desynchronize the broker/runner pair (`N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN`), so wdm reuses the existing values via `state.ReadStackEnv` on every update. See the wdm documentation for the CLI surface; do not edit the rendered `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` by hand, since wdm regenerates them on update.

After install, navigate to your configured domain and create an owner account. The reference content below describes the rendered stack (configuration knobs, security baseline, data layout) for troubleshooting and catalog-template work.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Postgres superuser (used only for init) | Yes |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Postgres superuser password | Yes |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name (default: `n8n`) | Yes |
| `POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_USER` | n8n DB user (least privilege) | Yes |
| `POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD` | n8n DB user password | Yes |
| `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 32-byte hex — encrypts saved credentials | Yes |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN` | Shared n8n ↔ runner token | Yes |
| `N8N_HOST` | Hostname only (no scheme) | Yes |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | Full external URL with trailing slash | Yes |
| `TZ` | Container timezone | No (default: `Europe/Bratislava`) |

### Reverse Proxy (Caddy)

```
n8n.example.com {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:5678
}
```

## Ports

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 5678 | HTTP | n8n editor & webhooks (bound to `127.0.0.1`) |
| 5679 | RPC  | Task-runner broker (internal network only) |
| 5680 | RPC  | Runner health (internal network only) |

## Data Persistence

| Storage | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `./db_storage` (bind mount) | PostgreSQL data (`/var/lib/postgresql/data`) — postgres self-chowns it on init |
| `n8n_storage` (named volume) | n8n workflows, settings, encrypted credentials (`/home/node/.n8n`) |

`n8n_storage` is a **named volume**, not a host bind mount. The n8n image runs
as the unprivileged `node` user (UID 1000) with `cap_drop: ALL` and no chowning
entrypoint, so a bind mount — whose host source Docker auto-creates root-owned —
makes n8n crash on first boot with `EACCES` writing `/home/node/.n8n`. A named
volume is seeded node-owned from the image, matching the official n8n-hosting
compose examples. wdm never runs `docker compose down -v`, so removing the stack
**preserves** `n8n_storage` (and `db_storage`): the named volume is listed in
the removal summary (as `wdm-n8n_n8n_storage`), and `db_storage` stays inside
the preserved stack directory the summary shows, so you know what was kept.

The runner is stateless — no volume needed.

## Security Features

This template ships with a hardened default configuration:

| Layer | Setting | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Capabilities | `cap_drop: ALL` (postgres adds 5 init caps; n8n/runner add none) | No NET/SYS caps anywhere |
| Privileges | `security_opt: no-new-privileges` on all containers | Setuid binaries cannot gain caps |
| IPC | `ipc: private` on all containers | Isolated SysV/POSIX IPC namespace |
| Process budget | `pids` 200 / 500 / 300 (pg / n8n / runner) | Caps fork sprawl |
| Memory / CPU | Per-container limits | One service can't starve the others |
| Three-network split | `n8n-db` and `n8n-runners` created with `--internal` | Postgres + runner have no internet egress |
| Port exposure | `127.0.0.1:5678` only | Only the reverse proxy can reach n8n |
| DB user | `POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_USER` (created by `init-data.sh`) | n8n never has Postgres superuser |
| Task runner | Code/Function nodes execute in a separate container | Workflow JavaScript can't touch n8n's process memory |
| Healthchecks | `pg_isready` / `wget` `/healthz` — no creds on cmdline | Built-in scripts only |
| Telemetry | `N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false` | No phone-home |
| File perms | `N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true` | n8n refuses to start if `~/.n8n/config` is world-readable |

> **Code nodes can't make outbound HTTP calls by default** because the
> runner is on an internal network. If a workflow needs external HTTP
> from JavaScript, use n8n's **HTTP Request node** (runs in the n8n
> container, has internet via `n8n-front`). To allow outbound from the
> runner anyway, drop `internal: true` on the `n8n-runners` network.

> **Why `N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0`?**
> n8n's broker defaults to `127.0.0.1`, which is only reachable inside
> the n8n container. With the runner in a separate container, the bind
> has to widen. `0.0.0.0` means *all interfaces of the n8n container* —
> **not** all host interfaces. Three layers actually contain the broker:
> 1. The `n8n-runners` network is created with `--internal`, so it has
>    no route to the host or the internet.
> 2. There is no `ports:` mapping for 5679, so the host kernel never
>    sees that port — `iptables -L` won't show it, nothing from outside
>    Docker can reach it.
> 3. `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN` authenticates every task RPC, so even a
>    process that somehow ended up on the `n8n-runners` network couldn't
>    dispatch work without the secret.
>
> The listen address inside the container is a routing concern; the
> `--internal` network is the security boundary.

> **Postgres image upgrade (optional):** swap `postgres:18.4` for
> `dhi.io/postgres:18` (Docker Hardened Images) for a distroless base
> with faster CVE patches. Requires a DHI subscription.
