[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) is a self-hosted monitoring tool for tracking uptime of websites, APIs, and services. Beautiful UI, multiple notification channels, and status pages.

## Features

- **Multiple Monitor Types** — HTTP(s), TCP, Ping, DNS, and more
- **Status Pages** — Public status pages for your services
- **Notifications** — 90+ notification services (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Email...)
- **Beautiful UI** — Modern, responsive dashboard
- **Multi-Language** — Available in 30+ languages
- **Certificate Monitoring** — SSL certificate expiry alerts
- **Maintenance Windows** — Scheduled maintenance periods

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- External Docker networks (`kuma`, `kuma-db`)
- Reverse proxy (Caddy, Nginx, Traefik)

## Installation

This template is managed by **wdm** — wdm renders `docker-compose.yml.tmpl` and `.env.tmpl` into your stack directory, pre-creates the `kuma` and `kuma-db` (`--internal`) networks, generates secrets via `crypto/rand`, and runs `docker compose up -d` at install time. The `--internal` flag on `kuma-db` blocks all internet egress for MariaDB — it only needs to talk to the kuma container, never the outside world. See the wdm documentation for the CLI surface; do not edit the rendered `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` by hand, since wdm regenerates them on update.

After install, open Uptime Kuma at `http://127.0.0.1:3008` (or via your reverse proxy), create an admin account, and start adding monitors. The reference content below describes the rendered stack (configuration knobs, security baseline, data layout) for troubleshooting and catalog-template work.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD` | MariaDB root password | Yes |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_DB_NAME` | Application database name | Yes |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_DB_USERNAME` | Non-root DB user (least privilege) | Yes |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_DB_PASSWORD` | Non-root DB user password | Yes |
| `TZ` | Container timezone | No (default: `Europe/Bratislava`) |

### Reverse Proxy (Caddy)

```
status.example.com {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:3008
}
```

## Ports

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 3008 | HTTP | Web interface |

## Data Persistence

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `./data` | Uptime Kuma application data |
| `./db` | MariaDB data directory (`/var/lib/mysql` inside the container) |

> **Migrating from a previous LSIO MariaDB setup?**
> The old image stored data under `./config` in LSIO's layout, which isn't readable by the official MariaDB image. Either dump first and re-import:
> ```bash
> docker exec mariadb mysqldump -u root -p"$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD" \
>   "$UPTIME_KUMA_DB_NAME" > uptime-kuma.sql
> # ... swap stacks, then on the new MariaDB:
> docker exec -i uptime-kuma-mariadb mysql -u root -p"$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD" \
>   "$UPTIME_KUMA_DB_NAME" < uptime-kuma.sql
> ```
> ...or start fresh if you don't need historical monitor data.

## Security Features

This template ships with a hardened default configuration:

| Layer | Setting | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Capabilities | `cap_drop: ALL` on both containers, minimal `cap_add` | No SYS_ADMIN, NET_ADMIN, etc. |
| Privileges | `security_opt: no-new-privileges` | Setuid binaries cannot gain caps |
| IPC | `ipc: private` | Isolated SysV/POSIX IPC namespace |
| Process budget | `pids` limits via `deploy.resources` | Fork-bomb resistance |
| Memory / CPU | `memory` & `cpus` limits | One service can't starve the others |
| Network | `kuma-db` created with `--internal` | MariaDB has no internet egress |
| Port exposure | `127.0.0.1:3008:3001` | Only the reverse proxy can reach kuma |
| DB user | `MARIADB_USER` / `MARIADB_PASSWORD` (non-root) | App connects with least privilege |
| Healthchecks | Built-in image scripts only | No credentials on the command line |
| Ephemeral writes | `tmpfs` for `/tmp` and `/run/mysqld` | Nothing survives container restart |

> **ICMP ping monitor:** the kuma container has `cap_add: NET_RAW` so the
> built-in ping monitor works. If you only use HTTP/TCP/DNS/Push monitors,
> remove that cap for a stricter baseline.

## Monitor Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| HTTP(s) | Website availability and response time |
| TCP Port | Port connectivity check |
| Ping | ICMP ping monitoring |
| DNS | DNS resolution check |
| Push | Heartbeat monitoring (cron jobs, etc.) |
| Steam Game Server | Game server status |
| Docker Container | Container health via Docker socket |
